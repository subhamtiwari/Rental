Okay, here's a draft for a `README.md` file for your GitHub repository. It includes setup instructions, explanations, and reflects the current state of the project using Groq.

# AI Leasing Agent Voice Bot

This project is an AI-powered voice assistant designed to handle incoming phone calls for an apartment leasing office. It can understand caller questions, provide information about the property (using a simulated database for now), and carry on a basic conversation.

Built with the help of [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/).

## Features

*   **Handles Incoming Calls:** Uses Twilio Programmable Voice to answer phone calls.
*   **Speech Recognition:** Transcribes the caller's speech using Twilio's built-in STT via `<Gather>`.
*   **Natural Language Understanding:** Leverages a Large Language Model (currently configured for Groq's Llama 3 via their OpenAI-compatible API) to understand the intent behind the caller's questions.
*   **Information Retrieval:** Queries an internal (currently simulated) database containing apartment details (pricing, availability, amenities, hours, pet policy).
*   **Text-to-Speech:** Responds to the caller using Twilio's standard TTS voice.
*   **Conversational Flow:** Engages in a multi-turn conversation, asking follow-up questions ("Is there anything else I can help you with?").
*   **Basic Error Handling:** Provides feedback to the caller if API connections or speech recognition fail.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python 3.x with Flask
*   **Telephony & STT/TTS:** Twilio Programmable Voice
*   **LLM:** Groq API (currently using `llama3-8b-8192`) via the `openai` Python library
*   **Environment Variables:** `python-dotenv`
*   **Development Tunneling:** `ngrok`

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the environment
    # Windows (PowerShell/CMD):
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or manually:
    # pip install Flask twilio python-dotenv openai
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
    *   Add your API keys to this file:
        ```dotenv
        # .env

        # Required: Get from https://console.groq.com/keys
        GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourActualGroqApiKeyHere"

        # Optional: Add Twilio credentials if needed for other features later
        # TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        # TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token_here"
        ```
    *   **Important:** Replace `gsk_YourActualGroqApiKeyHere` with your actual Groq API key. Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore`.

5.  **Configure Twilio Phone Number:**
    *   Obtain a Twilio phone number capable of receiving voice calls.
    *   You will need a publicly accessible URL for your running Flask application (see step 6).
    *   In the Twilio Console, navigate to your phone number's settings.
    *   Under "Voice & Fax" -> "A CALL COMES IN", set it to **Webhook**, **HTTP POST**, and enter your public URL followed by `/voice` (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/voice`).

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask Server:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure your virtual environment is active
    flask run --port 8080
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open.

2.  **Expose Local Server with ngrok:**
    *   Download and authenticate `ngrok` ([ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)).
    *   Open a **new** terminal window.
    *   Run `ngrok` to forward traffic to your Flask app's port:
        ```bash
        ngrok http 8080
        ```
    *   `ngrok` will display a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`). Copy this URL.

3.  **Update Twilio Webhook:** Ensure the public HTTPS URL from `ngrok` (with `/voice` appended) is configured in your Twilio phone number settings as described in Setup step 5.

4.  **Make a Call:** Call your Twilio phone number. The Flask app should process the call via the ngrok tunnel. Check the Flask terminal for logs.

## Future Improvements

*   Integrate with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Supabase) instead of the in-memory dictionary.
*   Implement proper conversation state management/memory.
*   Add function calling capabilities for tasks like scheduling tours directly.
*   Integrate more advanced STT/TTS services (e.g., OpenAI Whisper/TTS, ElevenLabs) for potentially higher quality.
*   Develop more robust error handling and fallbacks.
*   Implement unit and integration tests.
*   Containerize the application (e.g., using Docker).

**How to Use:**

1.  Create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project (`D:\Be Different\Rental`).
2.  Copy the text above and paste it into the `README.md` file.
3.  **Crucially:** Replace `<your-repo-url>` in the "Clone the Repository" step with the actual URL of your GitHub repository once you create it.
4.  Commit this file to your repository. GitHub will automatically display its contents on the repository's main page.
